#Exercise 1
#Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number e.g. input 35 the output 3 +5 = 8
a = input("Introduce un numero: \n")
b = int(a[0])
c = int(a[1])
print("La suma de "+a+" es: ",(b+c))

#Exercise 2 
#Calculate BMI = w/h
height = input("Enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("Enter your weight in kg: ")

bmi = int(weight) / float(height) **2
print(int(bmi))

#Exercise 3
#Life in week
#Create a program to tells you how many days, weeks and months we have left if
#we life until 90 years old.
#1 year = 365 days
#1 year = 52 weeks
#1 year = 12 months
age = int(input("What is your current age?\n"))
time_left = 90 - age
days = time_left * 365
weeks = time_left * 52

#Final Exercise
#Tip Calculator
